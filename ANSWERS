1. a world writable file allows anyone to be able to modify the contents of a file, while a world writable directory allows anyone to be able to create, delete, modify, rename, and replace files as they wish, which could let an attacker have free reign to delete everything or upload malware
2. in perm -002 the dash means that all bits in the mask must be present, whereas in perm /111 the slash means that just one of the bits is enough. the dash checks if it can be runnable by everyone, whereas the slash checks if anyone can run it at all.
3. first you would need to fix the permissions using chmod o-w file, then check for any malicious changes done by an unwanted user, check the audit logs for anything suspicious, as well as for maybe implementing permission monitoring to better trace this next time.
4. this is because the first option creates a subshell within which the while loop  runs in, the issue being that anything modified inside the loop doesn't actually exist outside of the subshell, while the second option avoids creating a subshell entirely so the modifications can actually work.
5. first you would need to reprogram it to be able to send emails with something like "echo "$output" | mail -s" and then create a cron job using "crontab -e" and something like "0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/send_security_scan.sh" in order to get it to run the program at the proper time, sending the email to security daily.
